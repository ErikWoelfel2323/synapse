 *     Message Endpoint code is custom to both the application and the messaging systemâ€™s client API.
 *     The rest of the application knows little about message formats, messaging channels, or any of
 *     the other details of communicating with other applications via messaging. It just knows that
 *     it has a request or piece of data to send to another application, or is expecting those from
 *     another application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     It is the messaging endpoint code that takes that command or data, makes it into a message,
 *     and sends it on a particular messaging channel. It is the endpoint that receives a message,
 *     extracts the contents, and gives them to the application in a meaningful way.
